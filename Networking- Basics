TCP- Transmission Control Protocal -private
  =>sequence ,connection oriented,security  [chat]  
UDP- User Datagram Protocal-Public 
  =>sequence less ,less connection ,less security [post]
HTTP- Hyper text transfer protocal
  =>tranfer data between client nd server
IP address -where pc located   [eg phn num]
    curl ip config.me -s
ISP - internet service provider
port number- which application need to communicate  -16 bits -2(pow 16)-65 000
    HTTP -80
    Mongidb -27017
    sql- 1433    
    0 - 1023 - Reserved ports
    1024 -49152 -application like mongodb,sql..
    49152 -65 00 -our use
speed   1 Mbps -mega bits per sec  - 1000 000b/sec
        1 gbps -giga bits per sec - 10 (pow 9)b/sec

LAN - small ofc/home Via wifi ,ethernet
MAN - accross city
WAN - across country(fibre cables)

Topologies 
  BUS
  RING
  STAR
  TREE (BUS ND STAR]
  MESH (every pc conect to each other) expensive

OSI Layers  APS TN D P
  Application - software
  Presentation - collect the data frm app convert to machine readable binary format(translation)/encryption
                  for encryption - SSL protocol used(secure socket lyr)
  Session - auth /authorsation(eg session will create whn u login some website )
  Transport - work with data [3 parts  -1.segmentation:data received from session divided to segments 2.flow control:amount to data to tranfer
              3.error :if data lost]
  Netwrk -comunicate one server to another eg :router logical addressing 
  Data link -now data packet has data with ip of sender nd receiver  [mac idres]
  physical -connects router fr o/p
