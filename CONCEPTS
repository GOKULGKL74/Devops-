Unit testing is nothing but testing code for a block or specific functionality.
Static code analysis is to verify format, all indentation is right, syntax is right, make sure u didn't declare any unnecessary variables.
Code quality/ vulnerability testing is done to check for vulnerability, that can be misused by hackers
Automation testing/functional testing /endtoend testing, in this you verify your application in end to end manner such that one functionality doesn't affect other functionality.
Reports - reports for how many units test passed , what is code quality etc.
Deployment stage- deploying your application on a platform so that your customer can access your application.
